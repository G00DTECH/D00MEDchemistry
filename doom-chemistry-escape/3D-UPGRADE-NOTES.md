# DOOM Chemistry Escape Room - 3D Upgrade Complete

## Major Changes Made

### ðŸŽ® **Completely Rebuilt 3D Engine**
- **Before**: Simple 2D top-down view with basic transforms
- **After**: True 3D first-person raycasting engine like original DOOM

### ðŸ”§ **Core Technical Improvements**

#### 1. **Proper Raycasting Algorithm**
- Implemented DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) raycasting
- True perspective projection with distance-based wall heights
- Fisheye effect correction for realistic 3D view
- Wall-side based lighting (X-sides brighter than Y-sides)

#### 2. **Grid-Based Map System**
- Converted from line-based walls to efficient grid system
- 12x9 tile-based map for better collision detection
- Optimized raycasting performance with grid traversal

#### 3. **Enhanced Movement System**
- **WASD Controls**: Forward/backward + true strafing
- **Mouse Look**: Smooth horizontal rotation with pointer lock
- **Collision Detection**: Grid-based with radius checking
- **Smooth Movement**: 60 FPS performance target

#### 4. **3D Rendering Features**
- **Distance-based lighting**: Walls get darker with distance
- **Depth shading**: Different brightness for wall sides
- **Adaptive resolution**: Performance optimization
- **3D sprites**: Puzzle stations and items rendered as 3D objects
- **Proper ceiling and floor**: Realistic environment

#### 5. **Visual Enhancements**
- **True DOOM-style aesthetic**: Dark ceiling, lit floor
- **Dynamic lighting**: Distance-based brightness falloff
- **3D crosshair**: Center screen targeting reticle
- **Updated minimap**: Grid-based with proper scaling
- **Enhanced HUD**: Integrated 3D view components

### ðŸ§ª **Preserved Chemistry Features**
- All 6 chemistry puzzle types maintained
- Educational content fully intact
- Door/key mechanics work in 3D
- Scoring and progression system preserved
- Interaction system adapted for 3D view

### ðŸŽ¯ **Performance Optimizations**
- Adaptive rendering resolution (600px max width)
- Efficient DDA algorithm with iteration limits
- Reduced ray casting for better frame rates
- Optimized wall strip rendering

### ðŸŽ® **User Experience**
- Click canvas to lock mouse cursor
- Smooth 3D navigation
- Clear visual feedback for interactions
- Maintains educational gameplay flow

## Technical Specifications

- **FOV**: 60 degrees (Ï€/3 radians)
- **Render Distance**: 800 units maximum
- **Wall Height**: 100 units
- **Tile Size**: 64x64 units
- **Map Size**: 12x9 tiles
- **Target FPS**: 60

## Files Modified

1. **game.js** - Complete engine rewrite with raycasting
2. **index.html** - Updated control instructions and descriptions
3. **chemistry-components.css** - Maintained (no changes needed)

The game now provides a true 3D DOOM-like experience while maintaining all educational chemistry content!

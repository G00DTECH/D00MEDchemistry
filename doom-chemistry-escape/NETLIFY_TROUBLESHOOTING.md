```
Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R
Firefox: Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R  
Safari: Cmd + Shift + R
```

#### 3. **Clear Browser Cache**

### Netlify Platform Solutions

#### 5. **Force New Deployment**
1. Log into your Netlify dashboard
2. Go to your site â†’ **Deploys** tab
3. Click **"Trigger deploy"** â†’ **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
4. Wait for deployment to complete (green checkmark)

#### 6. **Verify File Upload**
1. In Netlify dashboard â†’ **Site overview**
2. Click **"Browse site files"** or **"Download deploy"**
3. Check that files show recent timestamps
4. Verify `index.html` contains "v2.0 âš¡" in title

#### 7. **Check Deploy Log**
1. Netlify dashboard â†’ **Deploys** tab
2. Click on latest deploy
3. Look for any **red error messages**
4. Common issues:
   - File upload failures
   - Permission errors
   - Build process problems

### File Upload Verification

#### 8. **Re-upload Complete Folder**
1. **Zip entire folder**: `doom-chemistry-escape.zip`
2. **Delete old site** in Netlify (optional but thorough)
3. **Create new site** by dragging zip file
4. **Test immediately** with hard refresh

#### 9. **Check File Permissions**
- Ensure all files are readable
- No special characters in filenames
- File sizes under Netlify limits (usually not an issue for this project)

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### 10. **DNS/CDN Issues**
- Try accessing via different internet connection
- Use different DNS (Google: 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1)
- Check site from different geographic location (ask friend)

#### 11. **Netlify Configuration Check**
Verify these files exist and are correct:
- `netlify.toml` - Build configuration
- `_headers` - Caching and security headers  
- `_redirects` - URL routing

#### 12. **Browser Developer Tools Check**
1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Network tab** â†’ Reload page
3. Look for:
   - **304 responses** (cached content - bad)
   - **200 responses** (fresh content - good)
   - **Failed requests** (red entries)

### Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- âœ… Browser tab shows: **"DOOM Chemistry Escape Room - Interactive Educational Game"**
- âœ… Start screen shows: **"Chemistry Escape Room v2.0 âš¡"**
- âœ… Number key quiz system works (press 1-4 in quizzes)
- âœ… All performance improvements are active
- âœ… Floor is visible when playing

### Last Resort Solutions

#### 13. **Complete Fresh Deploy**
1. **Download** current deployed files from Netlify
2. **Compare** with your local files using file comparison tool
3. **Create new Netlify site** with fresh URL
4. **Upload** your local folder to new site
5. **Test** new URL immediately

#### 14. **Alternative Hosting Test**
- Try uploading to **Vercel** or **GitHub Pages** temporarily
- This helps confirm if it's a Netlify-specific issue
- Use same files to ensure consistency
